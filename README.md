## About Myself
My name is Matt Lancaster, and I am a current student at the University of Iowa (**Go Hawks!**) studying Finance and Business Analytics. Outside the classroom, I enjoy watching both professional and college athletics (especially the Chiefs as I'm originally from Kansas City), working out, and spending time with friends and family. Inside the classroom, my interests span from statistical data analysis to financial management and investment. 

### Current Technical Skills
*Microsoft Excel* - **linear regression** (simple and multiple), **forecasting** (exponential smoothing and moving average), and **optimization** (Simplex LP).

*Python* - Beginning with almost no prior knowledge, I am learning the Python coding language in a Computational Thinking course.

*PowerBI* - Extensive practice in creating interactive dashboards to display a company's financial performance for a Managerial Accounting and Data Visualization class.


#### Origin of Repository
This repository is the product of a Business Analytics Professional Preparation Course. It's aim is to help our understanding of the GitHub platform and to practice the process of creating a repository.
